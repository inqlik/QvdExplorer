QVD Explorer
-------------

Simple tool to exlore QVD files.

##Installation

- Clone project or copy directory `QvdExplorer` anywhere in your system. Probably path to `QvdExplorer` directory should not contain non-aschii symbols and spaces. 
- Run `setup.bat` (you can do it just double clicking that batch file in the file explorer). That operation will install new target `QvdExplore` to `Send to` context menu in file explorer.
